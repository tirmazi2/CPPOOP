FYP Automation System

Final year project (FYP) is a core requirement of any degree program. Hence, it is important to understand the key concepts and activities involved in the automation of a FYP process. This may help to enhance the communication and contribution towards the assigned activities to the students and monitoring of the FYP tasks by the instructors as well. For this semester project, students are required to develop an Automated FYP System. 
The stakeholders directly involved with the proposed system include:
 1) Project coordinator/administrator
 2) Supervisors 
3) Students 
4) Evaluators

Therefore, the system is divided into three modules based on their functionalities. 
These are: 
1) Project management module 
2) File repository management module 
3) Submission & grading module

During the academic year, the coordinator will register / add final year students to the system (through filing system) and will allocate the supervisor and project. He/she is able to manage the student/supervisor/project record/profile. Coordinator is also able to maintain evaluators profile and can allocate projects for evaluation to evaluators. Coordinator can maintain the schedule and status of the projects in the department.  

	Supervisor can add topics of projects
	Supervisor can view the no of groups assigned
	Supervisor can maintain schedule for each activity in the project with deadlines and status.
	Supervisor can view the student profile, project profile and can maintain the schedule and the status of the project under his/her supervision.
	Supervisor can mark/grade a project under supervision

	Evaluators can grade the project(s) assigned to them and can view student/supervisor/project profiles.

	Student should be able to update his/her profile
	Students can view supervisor profile
	Student can view the list of topics proposed by supervisors and the list of topics already assigned Student can view the activities assigned in a task and can update its status
	Student can update the project status (assigned, approved, under-implementation, report writing, prototyping so on)
	Students can view their scheduled tasks and deadlines by the supervisor
	Students can view their grades

OOP Concepts to be used in this Project
